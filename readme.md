# NCDiscord Bot

## TODO
* Make bot configurable. The hosting service supports SQLite3 out of the box
  * It should be possible to specify which roles are valid
  * Currently the bot only reacts to messages in #person-vouching. This should be a configurable channel
* Setup GitLab
  * Make bot.py testable and write tests
  * Create file `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of the project
  
## Suggestions
* Enable the bot to react in all channels
