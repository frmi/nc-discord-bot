# NCDiscord Bot

## TODO
* Make bot configurable. The hosting service supports SQLite3 out of the box
  * It should be possible to specify which roles are valid
  * Currently the bot only reacts to messages in #person-vouching. This should be a configurable channel
  
## Suggestions
* Enable the bot to react in all channels
